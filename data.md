Data
----

In order to complete this project, we will need two major sources of data:

1. A database containing user profiles with their restaurant preferences. For now, users will have a name, a list of restaurants they enjoy, and a list of restaurants they wish to avoid. (A future version could eventually allow for a more complex profile.)

2. The Foursquare location data to help find a restaurant. (A future version could make use of a restaurants rating to help select a location.)

In a future version, a third dataset would be useful for New York users:

3. The NYC Open Data webpage contains a listing of restaurant grades given by the city. This could be used to select restaurants with a minimum grade score.

Example of user data:

User: James
Likes: Taco House 39, Chen's Garden, Pho Viet
Dislikes: Pizza Hut, La Sorrentina
